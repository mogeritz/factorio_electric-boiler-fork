# Electric Boiler Mod, forked from Mobius1

This is a fork of Mobius1's original [Electric Boiler mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/electricboiler)
The Compatabilities with Bob's mods were improved; you no longer need bob's electronics to access higher tiers of electric Boilers

# Adds an Electric Boiler to the game.
There is a config setting that allows you to change the power consumption/output of the boiler in MW. If you input 2000 it'll result in 2GW on the tooltip box. Which means it'll consume 2GW of power to produce lots of steam, maybe you want a powerful steam producer feeding a tank...
## The mod is also compatible with bob's mods but the setting configuration doesn't work for them, only the vanilla boiler.
## For a full compatibility with bob's mods, make sure you have all 3 dependencies (Not all are needed!):
- bobpower
- bobplates
- bobelectronics
